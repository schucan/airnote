A web page inside an internet address

With this single HTML file, you can stuff entire web pages into internet addresses (URLs).

## How to

Just open index.html in a browser, fill out the fields, and hit "Save".

The URL that is then called can be used to link to the resulting page.

## Deploy on a public server

Just upload the html file to any public web server.

## Legal implications

I am not sure who would be liable for the content of a web page that's published with this technique. 
The content of the web page is inside the link - not on the server that hosts the html file.
